# This is the First header called H1 Header, it's the largest! In code it looks like this: `<h1>`

###### This header has 6 hashtags! It's the smallest header. In code it looks like this: `<h6>`

### You can add different headers by adding up to 6 `#` characters followed by a space.

## Fun, right! And so simple! :)

If you want to display "code" text (yup I call it like that now) example `<h1>`, you have to use `-character in the beginning and in the end of the "code" text you want to display! Just noticed it myself. 

Also remember to preview your markdown first before committing :) 

### The next task in this course is to add an image and descriptive text to it. I used the example image of a Yaktocat (?! :D) from the course:

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

### Now we practice adding a code block! It says in the course that code blocks can render differently depending on the language. Let's try them out!

```
$ git init
This is an example yip/yip/Appa/Project/cookin-book/.git/
```
``` javascript
var myVar = "Heippa, maailma!";
```
