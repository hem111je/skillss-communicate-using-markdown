# This is the First header called H1 Header, it's the biggest. In code it looks like this:`<h1>`

## You can add different headers by adding up to 6 `#` characters followed by a space

###### This header has 6 hashtags! It's the smallest header. In code it looks like this: `<h6>`

### Fun, right! And so simple, you got this :)

If you want to display example `<h1>`, you have to use `-character in the beginning and in the end of the "code" text you want to display! Just noticed it myself. 

Also remember to preview your markdown first before committing :)
